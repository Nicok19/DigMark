submitForm.js File Documentation

The submitForm.js file is a React functional component that manages the state and behavior of a form. It imports and uses the Form component, which presumably renders the actual form elements.

The SubmitForm component uses the useState hook from React to manage the state of the form data. The initial state is an object with three properties: name, email, and comments, all of which are initialized as empty strings.

The handleChange function is an event handler for the form inputs. It uses the setFormData function (returned by useState) to update the state of the form data. It uses the spread operator (...) to create a new object with the current form data, and then updates the value for the input that triggered the event. The name of the input field is used as the key, and the value of the input field is used as the value.

The handleSubmit function is an event handler for the form submission. It prevents the default form submission behavior, which would cause a page reload. It then attempts to send a POST request to 'Example_fetch_post_url' with the form data. The actual implementation of this fetch request is not provided in the given code.

Please note that this is a basic documentation based on the provided information. For a more accurate documentation, a full view of the code and its context would be necessary.
