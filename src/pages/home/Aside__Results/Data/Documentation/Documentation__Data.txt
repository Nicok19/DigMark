// Counter Component Documentation

This React component, `Counter`, implements a simple counter that starts counting up to a maximum value (`maxCount`) when the user scrolls down to a certain position on the page (500 pixels from the top). It uses hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and side effects.

## Counter Component

### Props
- `maxCount` (number): The maximum count value to which the counter will increment.

### State
- `count` (number): Current count value.
- `isInView` (boolean): Indicates if the component is in view (based on scroll position).

### useEffect Hooks

#### Scroll Listener
- Registers a scroll event listener when the component mounts (`useEffect(() => {...}, [])`).
- Updates `isInView` state based on scroll position.

#### Counting Logic
- Starts counting up (`setCount`) when `isInView` becomes `true`.
- Uses `setInterval` to increment `count` every 35 milliseconds until it reaches `maxCount`.
- Clears the interval when counting is complete.

### Return
- Renders a `<div>` with class `counterSection` and a `<h1>` displaying the current `count` value plus a `+`.

## Brands, Awards or Audience Component

### Description
- Simple functional component (`Brands, Awards, Revenue or Audience`) that renders the `Counter` component with a `maxCount` of a number.

### Usage
- Import and use `<Brands, Awards, Revenue or Audience />` in your application where needed.
